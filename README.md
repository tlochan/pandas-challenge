Week 4 Pandas Challenge - PyCity

Analysis:

Overall, the City's School District has 15 schools educating nearly 40,000 students. Although the budget was around $24.6 million, the average math and reading scores were 79 and 82 respectively.

These unsatisfactory results prompted me to investigate each school in the district in order to further assess if there were any actionable insights.

Notably, there is a large variance in the schools in our district. The top performing school - Cabrera HS has 94% of students passing math and 97% passing reading. On the other hand, the lower performing schools such as Rodriguez and Figueroa had passing rates for math and reading of around 65% and 80%. It is interesting to note that the math passing rate was significantly lower than reading. As we prepare a plan to remedy the situation, we should focus our attention specifically to the math program in these schools.

Typically, trends in math and reading held true across grade levels at each school with low variance. In other words, these issues are systemic and not due to any one particularly good or poor crop of students.

Incredibly, schools who spent the least on the students(<$585) scored the best across the board compared to the hightest spending schools ($645-680). These results directly oppose much of the educational research, so I would be keen to see more information regarding this dataset. I suspect that there is a confounding variable at play or maybe something I am overlooking in terms of how the results are collected. For example, do these schools simply have smaller budgets or is it instead a limited number of students that results in their success? We have historically seen smaller class sizes lead to pedagogical improvements.

On that note, small and medium schools (<1000, and 1000-2000 students) largely outperformed the large schools (2000-5000 students). There was a significant improvement in the math (~93.5% vs 70%) which we noted earlier as an area of concern. As we conduct further research, I anticipate this will be a promising lead to follow.

Lastly, it was also calculated that Charter schools outperformed the District schools. Looking at the overall summary table, it was apparent that these Charter schools are usually small/medium schools as well.
